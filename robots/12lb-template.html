      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>The Atlas is probably the best-known BattleMech to ever set foot on the modern battlefield. Designed with
        specifications from Aleksandr Kerensky himself in 2755[2] in the midst of the Cameron Edicts, the Atlas was originally
        intended to ensure SLDF superiority over the Star League member states. Though the inexorable arming of the Great
        Houses continued, the Atlas proved itself to be everything General Kerensky requested. With the largest amount of
        armor of nearly any 'Mech, crippling firepower, and the foreboding skull-shaped "Death's Head" cockpit/head assembly,
        the Atlas lived up to its reputation. The mere sight of an Atlas had been known to make even a veteran MechWarrior
        break out in a cold sweat, and theoretically a single Atlas can take on and wipe out an entire battalion of Stingers
        in exchange for minor armor loss.
      
        The Atlas' first combat trials came during the Amaris Civil War, where it served an instrumental role as a powerful
        command vehicle. Though General Kerensky is well-known for being the one who kicked down the palace doors of the
        Usurper in his Orion, it was his close friend Aaron DeChavilier who, in his Atlas, weathered the storm of enemy fire
        and breached the protective wall surrounding the complex. After this conflict it was therefore with little surprise
        that the General wished for all of these 'Mechs to accompany him on Operation EXODUS, but ironically of those
        MechWarriors who refused his summons fully two-thirds were Atlas pilots. These units were spread among the Successor
        States and Atlas factories on Al Na'ir, Hesperus II and Quentin would continue production of the 'Mech through the
        Succession Wars.
      
        Most commanders were loath to tamper too much with such a successful 'Mech, but the recovery of the Helm Memory Core
        resulted in a number of ancient designs being updated with lostech, and the Atlas was no exception. The new AS7-K
        model was released in 3049, just in time to fight off the Clan Invasion. The Federated Commonwealth also briefly began
        production of their own model, the AS7-S, although following the civil war that line was discontinued and further
        variants have been introduced by the Lyran Alliance and Draconis Combine. Despite its age, well into the end of the
        thirty-first century there were no plans to replace the Atlas, and even the most cutting-edge designs will stop and
        pause when faced with the prospect of an Atlas bearing down on them.</p>
      <h2>Design</h2>
      <p>The Atlas is armed with a multitude of weapons for both long and short range combat, all designed specifically to be
        as visible as possible so as to strike fear in the hearts of its enemies. For long ranges, the 'Mech carries a FarFire
        Maxi-Rack LRM-20 in the left torso that allows it to both fire directly at an enemy target at long range, and to give
        indirect fire support when needed. Unable to fit a full twenty-tube system on the 'Mech, the FarFire instead launches
        the missiles in waves of five over the course of ten seconds and carries two tons of reloads for twelve such salvos.
        For close range combat the 'Mech is armed with a Defiance 'Mech Hunter Autocannon/20 in the right torso with two tons
        of ammo. Although lacking a cooling jacket and liable to overheat, the massive autocannon gives the Atlas the
        firepower to take on an entire 'Mech company.
      
        To back up the AC/20 the Atlas carries four Defiance B3M medium lasers, one in each arm and two mounted in the rear
        center torso, and a TharHes Maxi SRM-6 launcher with one ton of missiles in the left torso (the aperture between the
        SRM and LRM launchers is not another weapon but an omnicoupling for power and coolant cable connection). Furthermore
        the Atlas is equipped with hand actuators which, combined with its sheer weight and power, makes it a potent
        hand-to-hand fighter. Accounts of Atlases actually picking up medium-weight 'Mechs and throwing them around like toys
        makes for suitable horror stories and further enhances the aura of the 'Mech.
      
        Carrying nineteen tons of armor, almost the entire weight of some light 'Mechs, makes the Atlas one of the
        best-protected 'Mechs ever built; its armoring is particularly thick on the front chest and legs. Its use of twenty
        heat sinks also gives the 'Mech an efficient heat management system. If there is one disadvantage to the Atlas it is
        its speed, with a rather slow cruising speed of 32.4 km/h. This makes it easy for most enemy 'Mechs to outrun the
        Atlas and so escape its clutches, which as it so happens is also the best chance most enemy 'Mechs have of surviving
        an encounter with this beast.
      
        A full year of development went into crafting the famous "Death's Head" of the 'Mech to achieve the perfect ratio of
        functionality and fear. The head is also quite roomy and allows a small satellite dish to be mounted for
        surface-to-space communications. During combat the pilot can easily fold up the dish and store it within a protective
        portion of the head.
